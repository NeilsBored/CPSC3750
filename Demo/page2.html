      <h2>It's not just the story...</h2>
      <p>Everyone has their own definition of what makes something good on screen. For some, it’s fast-paced action and flashy effects. For others, it’s complex dialogue or brilliant acting. But for me? It always comes down to impact.
        <br>
        A good movie or show lingers. You walk out of the theater or close your laptop, and you’re still in it. You’re thinking about the choices the characters made. You’re remembering a single line that hit like it was meant just for you. Or maybe there’s a feeling you can’t quite name, but it’s sitting in your chest like it belongs there.
        <br>
        I tend to gravitate toward stories that say something without screaming. That doesn’t mean slow, boring, or overly abstract—it just means films that trust the audience to meet them halfway. The Lighthouse, Everything Everywhere All At Once — those are films that invite interpretation, and that’s the good stuff.

        <h3>So what makes for a good watch?</h3>
          <li>Strong character arcs – Not necessarily “good” characters, but ones who evolve, who get broken down, who reveal something true about being human.</li>
          <li>Visual intention – Every frame should be doing something, whether it’s mood, symbolism, or just emotional texture. A great movie doesn’t waste its camera.</li>
          <li>Sound and silence – Music swells, dialogue cuts, ambient noise—these things are more than background. They shape the emotional landscape.</li>
          <li>Theme and subtext – A film with nothing under the surface might entertain me, but it won’t stay with me. Give me layers. Give me questions.</li>
