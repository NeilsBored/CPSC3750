				<h2>I'm Shane...</h2>
				<p>Welcome to my little corner of the internet.
					<br>
					I’m someone who believes that movies and shows are more than just entertainment—they’re emotional time machines, mirrors of the human condition, and sometimes, just beautifully crafted nonsense.
					<br>
					What started as just watching whatever was on TV turned into late nights overanalyzing every shot in Blade Runner 2049 or debating whether Atlanta was a wild trip or a therapy session.
					<br>
					Here, I share why movies and shows mean so much to me. It’s not just the visuals, the writing, or the acting—though all of those matter. It’s the feeling I get when a story sticks with me long after the credits roll.
					<br>
					Whether it’s a childhood favorite or a mind-bender I just watched last week, visual media helps me understand myself—and maybe even the world—a little better.</p>
